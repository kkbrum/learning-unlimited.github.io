# Current Programs

Learning Unlimited incubates and provides a national support structure for independent, college-student-led educational programs aimed at middle and high school students.

**Splash** is by far the most common Learning Unlimited program; it's a weekend extravaganza of classes at a local college or university, where pre-college students are invited to **learn about everything and anything** from passionate university students. Splash currently runs at [MIT](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html), at [Stanford University](https://stanfordesp.org/), at the [University of Chicago](https://splashchicago.learningu.org/), at [Duke University](https://dukesplash.learningu.org/), at [Yale University](https://yale.learningu.org/), at [Boston College](https://bcsplash.learningu.org), and many more! 

**Take a look at our [map](/current-programs/when-and-where) for a complete list and to find a Splash near you!**

Several groups also run a multi-week program, such as [**Cascade** at Chicago](https://splashchicago.learningu.org/learn/cascade.html), [**Sprout** at Yale](https://yale.learningu.org/learn/sprout.html), and [**HSSP** at MIT](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/HSSP/index.html). This program has been going strong at MIT since 1957! Classes at these programs are taught over several weeks, and cover material in greater depth than the typical Splash class.
